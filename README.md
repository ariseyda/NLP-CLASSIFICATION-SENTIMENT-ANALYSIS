# 🗣️ NLP Classification & Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform **text classification** and **sentiment analysis** using various machine learning algorithms. The notebook walks through all essential NLP preprocessing steps and model evaluations to identify the best-performing classifiers on labeled text data.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess raw text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.)
- Transform text into numerical features using **TF-IDF** and **Bag of Words**
- Apply multiple classification algorithms to detect sentiment (positive, negative, etc.)
- Evaluate and compare model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports
